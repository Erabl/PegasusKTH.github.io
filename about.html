        <p>Due to the nature of KTH courses, students normally need to finish specific
          courses(get passing grades) before they can start</br>
          taking other courses from the course list. Those courses that are supposed to be taken before hand are called
          "prerequisites".</br>
          We as KTH students found it extremely necessary to find prerequisites somewhere so that we could plan our
          study better.</p>

        <p>However, in order to get the prerequisites related information, students are required to browse through
          the course page of the</br>
          course that they want to find prerequisites for. Therefore we are aiming at gathering information of prerequisites
          for all KTH</br>
          courses and assemble them. </p>

        <p>This website is designed mainly as a course searching engine for KTH students to find prerequisites of a particular
          course. A</br>
          course code of the course that the user is interested in is supposed to be provided by user so that the prerequisites
          will be</br>
          displayed as both a tree and a list.</p>
